What the numbers mean?
  - **Instruction Coverage (61%):** It means 61% of the individual instructions in the contract's bytecode were executed at least once during testing.
  - **Branch Coverage (156 branches):** This shows the fuzzer encountered 156 different branches in the code. Branches occur at conditional statements (if/else, require, etc.). This is the total count rather than a percentage.
  - **Path Coverage (44 paths):** The fuzzer discovered 44 unique execution paths through the contract. Each path represents a different sequence of operations from start to finish.
  - **Issues Detected (0 issues):** No vulnerabilities or bugs were found during the fuzzing campaign which is excellent news.
  - **Total Test Cases (1,449,414 cases):** The fuzzer generated and executed nearly 1.5 million different test scenarios against the contract. This is a very high number and gives good confidence in the results.

What the percentages mean?
  - **30%** is the percentage of transactions that executed **successfully**
  - **0%** is the percentage of transactions that **reverted due to being out of gas**
  - **70%** is the percentage of transactions that **failed**. 

### NOTES ###

**Having 70% failed transactions in the fuzzing results isn't necessarily bad - it actually shows that the contract's security checks are working properly.** 

Fuzzing tools deliberately try invalid inputs and edge cases to find vulnerabilities. A high percentage of failed transactions often indicates that:
  - **Input validations are working correctly** - The contract is properly rejecting invalid operations
  - **Require statements are effective** - Conditions like insufficient balances or unauthorized access are being caught
  - **Security guardrails are active** - The fuzzer is trying to break the contract and failing

**The 0% of transactions running out of gas is a good sign - it indicates the contract doesn't have any unexpected gas traps or infinite loops.**

What matters most is that:
  - Zero vulnerabilities were detected across nearly 1.5 million test cases
  - The contract behaved as expected for both valid and invalid inputs
  - Residual risk remained very low (0.014%)

**CONCLUSION** - While 70% failed transactions might seem high, it's actually evidence that the contract is correctly enforcing its rules and rejecting invalid operations - exactly what you want to see in a secure contract.
